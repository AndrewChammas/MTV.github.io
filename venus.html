								<h3>Design Context</h3>
								<p>Venus is, in many ways, Earth’s twin. Its similar in size, mass, and distance from the sun but the
									surface conditions on Venus are vastly different to the life supporting conditions found on Earth. It
									is believed that Venus was once even more like Earth with land features that point to volcanic and
									tectonic activity as well as historic presence of water. However, the current surface conditions are
									quite inhospitable with temperatures up to 470 ̊C, surface pressure 90 times that on Earth, and an
									atmosphere consisting largely of CO2 and sulphuric acid. This has made it a challenging place to
									visit, so there is very limited data to prove or disprove any theories about Venus’ past. </p>
								<p>Since the Magellan mission in 1994, there have been advances in technology that could give clearer
									maps of the surface, more conclusive analysis of the atmospheric and geologic makeup and facilitate
									longer-lived trips into the atmosphere itself. Data collected by the sophisticated instruments available
									today could not only teach us about Venus’ past, but also about Earth’s potential future. If the
									increasing greenhouse effect that is currently occurring were to cascade, Earth’s atmosphere could
									turn into a Venus-like atmosphere.
									</p>
								<h3>Relevance of Design Problem</h3>
								<p>For mission to Venus, there are three main scientific goals:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Understand the history of volatiles and liquid water on Venus and history of habitability
									</li>
									<li>Understand coupling between surface and the atmosphere</li>
									<li>Understand historic geological activity and if Venus is active today</li>
								</ul>	
								<p>One objective of the first goal would be to determine if liquid water was once on the surface. This
										can be investigated by determining the chemistry and mineralogy of rocks and analysing surface
										features that might indicate any historic presence of water. Another investigation would be into the
										isotopic ratios of Hydrogen or Oxygen in the atmosphere. This can also be coupled with investigating
										atmospheric escape rates. Another objective would be to determine volatiles in the atmosphere to
										determine atmospheric composition as well as determining mechanisms through which volatiles
										move from surface solids to the atmosphere. Finally, research into habitable environments and
										biosignatures should help understand the history of volatiles and liquid water on Venus. </p>
									<p>One objective of the second goal is to analyse the composition of chemical markers and rocks that
										are in contact with the atmosphere. Likewise, the atmospheric composition, pressure and temperature
										near the surface can also be investigated. 
										</p>
									<p>One objective of the third goal is to determine the tectonic composition and interior structure.
										Another objective would be to determine if Venus is either technically or volcanically active. 
										Looking for any changes in atmospheric chemistry or any surface deformations would assist in the
										investigation. </p>
